# Weather images classification with convolutional neural networks

## Description

This project presents the training of a convonutional neural network for the purpose of classifying weather phenomenon images from the following dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jehanbhathena/weather-dataset. This dataset consists of 6862 different images which belong to 11 different classes. These classes correspond to different weather phenomena. This dataset is not divided into training, test, and validation datasets, so these datasets need to be appropriately created. The trained model is capable of successfully recognizing and classifying new images.
